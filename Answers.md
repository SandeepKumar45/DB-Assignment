1. 

Relationship Type: The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a foreign key relationship. Specifically, it is a many-to-one (N:1) relationship from "Product" to "Product_Category."

Foreign Key in "Product" Table: The "Product" table contains a foreign key column named category_id, which refers to the primary key column id in the "Product_Category" table.

Association: Each record in the "Product" table is associated with a single category from the "Product_Category" table based on the value stored in the category_id column.

Cardinality: Each product belongs to one and only one product category. However, multiple products can belong to the same product category.


2.

Foreign Key Constraint: To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, a foreign key constraint should be defined on the category_id column in the "Product" table.

Referential Integrity: The foreign key constraint establishes referential integrity between the "Product" and "Product_Category" tables. It ensures that values in the category_id column of the "Product" table must exist as primary key values in the id column of the "Product_Category" table.

Input Validation in Application Layer: While the foreign key constraint ensures data integrity at the database level, additional input validation in the application layer can provide a user-friendly experience. The application should validate that users can only select existing categories when associating them with products.
